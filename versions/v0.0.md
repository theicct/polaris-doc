## Introduction
This version of the documentation is solely to test the Word-to-Markdown conversion pipeline.

## Section with tables
Get ready for some tables.

**Table 1:** *Example table.*

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Description                                   |

| HDT      | HDV      | Heavy-duty trucks (GVW \> 15 tonnes)          |

**Table 2:** *Another example table.*

| Roadmap powertrain | Roadmap fuel          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ICE Diesel         | Diesel                | Internal combustion engines and conventional hybrids powered by diesel and biodiesel blends |
| ICE Gasoline       | Gasoline              | Internal combustion engines and conventional hybrids powered by gasoline and ethanol blends |
| ICE Biodiesel      | Biodiesel             | Pure biodiesel powertrains                                                                  |
| ICE Ethanol        | Ethanol               | Pure ethanol powertrains                                                                    |
| PHEV Diesel        | Diesel, Electricity   | Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles powered by diesel fuel and electricity                     |
| PHEV Gasoline      | Gasoline, Electricity | Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles powered by gasoline fuel and electricity                   |
| ICE CNG            | CNG                   | Internal combustion engines powered by compressed natural gas and biogas                    |

## Equations section
### Simple exponential functions

Here is a sample equation:

$${e^{- \left( \frac{x}{\lambda} \right)}}^{k}$$

### Compound annual growth rate

And another one:

$$\text{Sales}_{C,\ V,y2} = \text{Sales}_{C,V,y1}\  \times \left( \ 1 + \text{CAGR}_{C,V,G} \right)^{y2 - y1}$$

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Polaris accomplishes the following things:

1.  Thing one

2.  Thing two

3.  Thing three

It is very good at all three. In fact, see [here](https://www.google.com/) for more information.
